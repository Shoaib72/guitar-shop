                <p>Basic music theory defines the elements that form harmony, melody,<br> and rhythm. It identifies
                    compositional elements such as song form,<br> tempo, notes, chords, key signatures, intervals,
                    scales,
                    and more.<br> It also recognizes musical qualities such as pitch, tone, timbre, texture,<br>
                    dynamics,
                    and
                    others.</p>
